# LaunchHacksSite

Website for LaunchHacks I, which took place in April 2019.

Unfortunately, LaunchHacks has been discontinued, and thus this website has been archived at https://launchhacks.bananiumlabs.com. We'd like to thank all of our wonderful sponsors, mentors, judges, participants, and team members who made LaunchHacks I awesome!
