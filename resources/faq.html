                        LaunchHacks is open to all high school students (9th to 12th grade). No experience is necessary, and we would love to see
                        new participants! However, if you have already graduated from high school, you can still attend as
                        a mentor!

                        Anything you want! Software projects are often the most popular type of submission, but we also welcome and encourage other
                        types of unique submissions, like hardware (Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, etc), invention prototypes, artwork,
                        or anything else you can think of. Even if you can't or don't want to code, there are still plenty

                        invite someone new to join your team - they will bring in new ideas and areas of expertise. At the
